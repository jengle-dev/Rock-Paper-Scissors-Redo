        <ul>
            <li>Rock wins against scissors because rocks can smash scissors.</li>
            <li>Paper wins against rock because paper can cover a rock.</li>
            <li>Scissors win against paper because scissors cut paper.</li>
            <li>If both players throw the same choice, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner.</li>
